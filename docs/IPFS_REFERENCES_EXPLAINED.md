# IPFS References in ZenTalk - What Stays and Why

## ‚úÖ Summary

ZenTalk **does NOT use IPFS for storage**. All media (avatars, files, etc.) is stored in **MeshStorage**, our custom distributed storage system with encryption and erasure coding.

However, you will still see "IPFS" mentioned in a few places. This document explains why these references are **correct and necessary**.

---

## üîç Where You'll See "IPFS" References

### 1. **go.mod and go.sum** (Dependency Files)

**File:** `go.mod`
```go
github.com/ipfs/boxo v0.35.0 // indirect
github.com/ipfs/go-cid v0.5.0 // indirect
github.com/ipfs/go-datastore v0.9.0 // indirect
github.com/ipfs/go-log/v2 v2.8.1 // indirect
```

**Why These Exist:**
- These are **indirect dependencies** of `libp2p` (our P2P networking library)
- libp2p was originally created for IPFS, so some packages still have "ipfs" in their names
- We use libp2p for:
  - Peer-to-peer networking
  - NAT traversal
  - Secure connections
  - DHT (Distributed Hash Table) for peer discovery

**Can We Remove Them?**
- ‚ùå NO - These are required by libp2p
- Removing them would break P2P networking completely
- These libraries don't do any IPFS storage - they're just networking utilities

---

### 2. **pkg/meshstorage/node.go** (Code)

**File:** `pkg/meshstorage/node.go:26`
```go
type DHTNode struct {
    host      host.Host
    dht       *dht.IpfsDHT  // ‚Üê This type name has "Ipfs"
    // ...
}
```

**Why This Exists:**
- `IpfsDHT` is the **type name** from libp2p's Kademlia DHT implementation
- It's called "IpfsDHT" because libp2p was originally created for IPFS
- This is **peer discovery DHT**, NOT IPFS storage

**What It Actually Does:**
- Finds peers in the ZenTalk network
- Stores encryption key bundles in DHT
- Routes messages between peers
- **Nothing to do with file storage**

**Can We Rename It?**
- ‚ùå NO - This is the official libp2p type name from `github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht`
- We added a comment explaining it's not IPFS storage

---

### 3. **Documentation** (AVATAR_UPLOAD_FLOW.md)

**File:** `AVATAR_UPLOAD_FLOW.md`

**Updated to:**
- ‚úÖ Changed "IPFS vs MeshStorage" ‚Üí "Storage Architecture Comparison"
- ‚úÖ Changed "No IPFS dependency" ‚Üí "No external storage dependencies"
- ‚úÖ Removed direct IPFS mentions from descriptions

**Why Comparisons Are Still Mentioned:**
- To explain why we built MeshStorage
- To show advantages over external storage services
- Historical context for the migration

---

## ‚ùå What We REMOVED (Actual IPFS Storage)

### Deleted Files:
- ‚úÖ `pkg/storage/ipfs.go` - IPFS upload/download code (DELETED)

### Removed Dependencies:
- ‚úÖ `github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-api` - IPFS HTTP client (REMOVED from go.mod)

### Updated Code:
- ‚úÖ All avatar/media uploads now use MeshStorage
- ‚úÖ Database schemas updated: `ipfs_cid` ‚Üí `mesh_chunk_id`
- ‚úÖ Protocol updated: 46-byte CIDs ‚Üí 8-byte chunk IDs

## üéØ Key Differences Explained

| Item | IPFS Storage | libp2p (DHT) |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | File storage (like Dropbox) | Peer networking (like BitTorrent DHT) |
| **What it does** | Stores and retrieves files | Finds peers, routes messages |
| **Do we use it?** | ‚ùå NO - We use MeshStorage | ‚úÖ YES - For P2P networking |
| **Can we remove it?** | ‚úÖ Already removed | ‚ùå Required for networking |

---

## üîê What ZenTalk Actually Uses

### Storage Architecture:
```
User uploads avatar
     ‚Üì
API Server receives base64 data
     ‚Üì
MeshStorage Client encrypts (AES-256-GCM)
     ‚Üì
Erasure codes into 15 shards
     ‚Üì
Distributes to 15 peers (found via libp2p DHT)
     ‚Üì
Returns chunk ID + encryption key
```

### Networking Architecture:
```
Client needs to send message
     ‚Üì
Uses libp2p DHT to find relay servers
     ‚Üì
Opens connection via libp2p
     ‚Üì
Sends encrypted message
```

**Key Point:** libp2p DHT is used for **finding peers**, not storing files!

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Run these commands to verify IPFS storage is completely removed:

```bash
# 1. Search for IPFS storage usage (should find ZERO matches)
grep -r "ipfs.NewShell\|go-ipfs-api" src/zentalk-protocol/pkg/

# 2. Search for IPFS CID in database (should find ZERO matches)
grep -r "ipfs_cid\|ipfs_key" src/zentalk-protocol/pkg/ --include="*.go"

# 3. Check go.mod (should NOT have go-ipfs-api)
grep "go-ipfs-api" src/zentalk-protocol/go.mod

# 4. Verify MeshStorage is being used
grep -r "MeshStorage" src/zentalk-protocol/pkg/api/

# 5. Check database schemas (should use mesh_chunk_id)
grep -r "mesh_chunk_id" src/zentalk-protocol/pkg/api/database/
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ No IPFS storage code found
- ‚úÖ No IPFS CID fields in database
- ‚úÖ No go-ipfs-api dependency
- ‚úÖ MeshStorage client is integrated
- ‚úÖ Database uses chunk IDs

## üéì For Developers

### If you see "IPFS" in code:

1. **Check if it's `dht.IpfsDHT`**
   - ‚úÖ This is correct - it's libp2p DHT (peer discovery)
   - Don't try to remove it

2. **Check if it's in `go.mod` indirect dependencies**
   - ‚úÖ This is correct - required by libp2p
   - Don't try to remove it

3. **Check if it's actual storage code**
   - ‚ùå This should be removed - report it!

### If you need to add storage:

- ‚úÖ **DO:** Use MeshStorage client (`s.MeshStorage.Upload()`)
- ‚úÖ **DO:** Store chunk IDs (uint64) in database
- ‚ùå **DON'T:** Use IPFS libraries
- ‚ùå **DON'T:** Store CIDs (content identifiers)

- **MeshStorage Architecture:** `STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Avatar Upload Flow:** `AVATAR_UPLOAD_FLOW.md`
- **Encryption Test:** `ENCRYPTION_TEST_GUIDE.md`
- **API Documentation:** `pkg/api/README.md`

## üöÄ Conclusion

**ZenTalk does NOT use IPFS for storage.**

All remaining "IPFS" references are:
1. ‚úÖ Required libp2p networking dependencies
2. ‚úÖ libp2p DHT type names (historical naming)
3. ‚úÖ Documentation explaining migration rationale

The codebase is **100% clean** of actual IPFS storage usage.
